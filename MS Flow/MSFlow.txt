1. Way to fire a flow (Trigger)

- Per user - e.g. the user clicks on the Flow button for mobile -> call a flow via HTTP request
- Recurrence schedule: Schedule a flow to run by pre-defined interval
- When an item is created (SP list item, D365 entity record, Outlook when a new email arrives ...)

Calling flow from external application:
- Create a flow with Http Request trigger, then use the generated url of created flow to call from external system, e.g. via javascript

2. Actions in Flow.
